# Student Registration/Info App with Realtime Database (Firebase)

This repository/project is an assignment given by EDGE Digital Skills Training Program, Batch CBI-018 under our Instructor Noor Mohammad Anik Sir.

The app displays a simple screen that shows 2 buttons:

- Add Student
- View All Students

It can perform basic add, update, view and delete operations, fulfilling the CRUD operations of a Database (Firebase).

There's also a call function, clicking the _Phone Icon_ directs you to the phone application where you can proceed to make a call.
